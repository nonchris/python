# You can use split to split a string on a given character
# example:
my_string_2 = "Hello World"
my_string_2_split = my_string_2.split(" ")  # split on space
# now my_string_2_split is a list with two elements: ["Hello", "World"]
print(my_string_2_split)

my_new_sting = "Hello, how are you?"
# TODO: split that string into a list of words and print the list


# You can check if a string contains a partial string with the in operator
if "a" in "abc":
    print("a is in abc")

# TODO: write an if statement that checks if "you" is in my_new_string


# you can negate a statement with the not operator
if "a" not in "abc":
    print("a is not in abc")


# TODO: write a for loop that prints all elements in my_string_2_split that do not contain "o"
