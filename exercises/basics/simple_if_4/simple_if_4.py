# TODO: write an if statement that checks if the string contains "Hello" and "World"


# TODO: check if the string is longer than three letters and smaller than 15


# TODO: check that the string contains "Hello" or is shorter than three characters


# TODO: replace 'my_str_ with a string that contains only three characters
#  and check that if you statement above still works

# TODO: check if my_str or my_str_2 is longer than five letters
